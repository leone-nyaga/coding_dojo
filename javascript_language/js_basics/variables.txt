In JavaScript we declare variables in three ways:
	1. var
	2. const
	3. let

1. let
You can use "let" keyword to declare a variable.

	let message;

In mordern JavaScript, let has replaced the "var" keyword.

2. var
you can use "var" keyword to declare a variable.

	var message;

In mordern JavaScript, "var" has been replaced by "let".

3. const
You can use "const" keyword to declare a variable.
Value declared cannot be changed later.

	const message;

RULES OF VARIABLE NAMING

1. Valid Characters: Variable names can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).

2.Cannot Start with a Digit: Variable names cannot start with a digit.
They must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.

3. Case-Sensitive: JavaScript is case-sensitive, so myVar, MyVar, and myvar are all considered different variables.

4. Reserved Keywords: You cannot use JavaScript reserved keywords (such as if, else, for, function, let, const, var, etc.) as variable names.

5. Meaningful: Choose variable names that are meaningful and descriptive of the data they represent.
This helps improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

6. CamelCase: It's common to use camelCase for variable names in JavaScript.
Start with a lowercase letter, and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word in the name (except the first word).
For example: myVariable, userName, totalAmount, etc.

7. Avoid Abbreviations: While short variable names might save typing time, they can make your code harder to understand.
Avoid using overly abbreviated or cryptic variable names.

8. Avoid Single Letters: Except for loop counters (such as i, j, k), avoid using single-letter variable names.
Instead, use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable.

9. Consistent Naming Conventions: Stick to a consistent naming convention throughout your codebase to maintain clarity and readability.
Whether you choose camelCase, snake_case, or another convention, be consistent.
