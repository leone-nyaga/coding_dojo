# STRUCTURES

C structures are special, large variables which contain several named variables inside. Structures are the basic foundation for objects and classes in C. Structures are used for:

+ Serialization of data
+ Passing multiple arguments in and out of functions through a single argument
+ Data structures such as linked lists, binary trees, and more
