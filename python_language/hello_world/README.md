## :snake: What is Python?

Python is a programming language that's:

+ High-level – Easy to read and write (close to human language)

+ Interpreted – You don’t need to compile it; just run it directly

+ Dynamically typed – You don’t have to declare variable types

+ Open-source – Free and supported by a huge community

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

## Characteristics of Python

+ It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
+ It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
+ It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
+ It supports automatic garbage collection.
+ It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.

## Who Invented Python?

Python was invented by a Dutch Programmer Guido Van Rossum in the late 1980s. He began working on Python in December 1989 as a hobby project while working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. Python's first version (0.9.0) was released in 1991.
