# 0x03. C - Debugging

**Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly.

Think of it like this:

+ You write a program.

+ Something doesn’t work — maybe it crashes, gives the wrong result, or behaves oddly.

+ You debug by:

  + Identifying where the problem is,

  + Understanding why it happens, and

  + Fixing it.

Common Debugging Steps:

1. Reproduce the problem

Make the bug happen consistently so you can study it.

2. Read the error message

Most programming languages show error messages — they often tell you where to look.

3. Use print statements or a debugger

Print values or step through your code line by line.

4. Isolate the issue

Test smaller parts of your code to narrow it down.

5. Fix the bug

Change your code — then test again to be sure it’s really fixed.

6. Think long-term

Ask yourself: Why did this happen? How can I prevent similar bugs later?
