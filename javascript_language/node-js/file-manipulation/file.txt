The most important functionalities provided by programming languages are Reading and Writing files from computers. Node.js provides the functionality to read and write files from the computer. Reading and Writing the file in Node.js is done by using one of the coolest Node.js modules called fs module, it is one of the most well-known built-in Node.js modules out there.

The file can be read and written in node.js in both Synchronous and Asynchronous ways. A Synchronous method is a code-blocking method which means the given method will block the execution of code until its execution is finished (i.e. Complete file is read or written). On the other hand, an Asynchronous method has a callback function that is executed on completion of the execution of the given method and thus allows code to run during the completion of its execution.
