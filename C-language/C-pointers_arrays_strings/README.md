# POINTERS

In C programming, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

Instead of holding an actual value, it holds the location in the computer's memory where that value is stored

This allows for direct manipulation of data in memory, which can be crucial for tasks like dynamic memory allocation, efficient array traversal, and passing arguments by reference to functions.
