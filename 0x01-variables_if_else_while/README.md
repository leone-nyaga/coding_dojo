## VARIABLES

A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value of a specific type.
You can think of variables as labeled boxes where you store data that your program can manipulate.

### Why use Variables?

+ To store data temporarily.

+ To refer to values by name rather than by memory address.

+ To change data throughout the execution of a program.

## Variable Declaration and Definition

```c
int age;
```

+ int is the type (integer).

+ age is the variable name.

+ This declaration reserves space for an integer in memory.

You can declare multiple variables of the same type on one line:

```c
int x, y, z;
```
